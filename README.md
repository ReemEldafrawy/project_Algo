b. Analyze Heap-Sort Algorithm
Build Max-Heap:
Time complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛)(derived from summing heapify operations for all nodes).
Heapify:
Time complexity: 
𝑂(log𝑛) per operation.
Heap-Sort:n
extractions, each taking 
𝑂(log𝑛)
Total time complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)

b. Analyze Kruskal’s Algorithm
Sort Edges:
Time complexity: 
𝑂(𝐸log𝐸), where 
𝐸 is the number of edges.
Union-Find Operations:
Time complexity: 
𝑂(𝛼(𝐸)) per operation, where 
𝛼is the inverse Ackermann function.
Total Time Complexity:
𝑂(𝐸log𝐸+𝐸⋅𝛼(𝑉)),
which simplifies to 
𝑂(𝐸log𝐸)
